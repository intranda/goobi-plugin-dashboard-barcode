## Overview and functionality
To use this dashboard plugin, you first need to activate it via `Settings` -> `General` -> `Dashboard` and then log in again. If the plugin is correctly installed and configured, it should already be activated under the `Dashboard` menu item.

On the right side, there is a form with various actions. You can select one by clicking on it. If the action `Change Location Only` is chosen, an additional input field will appear, expecting the name of the new location. For all actions, there is a mandatory input field where the title of the Goobi process is expected. This field is automatically focused after loading to facilitate the use of a barcode scanner. By clicking the `Execute` button, the selected action will be performed, and messages regarding success will be displayed. The performed action and the input location are saved to facilitate further applications. They remain unchanged until a manual change is made.

## Configuration
The plugin is configured in the file `plugin_intranda_dashboard_barcode.xml` as shown here:
